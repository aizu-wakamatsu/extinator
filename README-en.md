## Premise 
Snow piles up in winter. We can't ride a bicycle and we don't want to walk in snow. There is also a risk of falling when we walk on icy road.

## Purpose of this project

Automobiles are so cool. We can go everywhere as long as the road lasts. We get speed by driving a car. Engine sound makes us excited. Cars are fun.

Think, is automobile a reasonable transportation method to move people? We may answer "Yes" if there are four people with big suitcases and we want to go to the place very far from here. We can enjoy talking in the car and we don't have to mind other persons. The traveling cost per person is low. Our travel will be so fun. Then, if there is only me and I want to go to near place with small luggage? I will answer "No". The traveling cost won't change by the number of person in the car so I have to pay the cost of four people. When it is a snowing day, we have to clear the snow on the roof. Cars need wide space to park. We don't need high speed to go to near place. Moving big lump of metal for only one person is not reasonable. Bicycle doesn't consume any fuel or electricity and it will be reasonable mobility but we can't ride them in winter and they have a risk of overturning. Then, we want to make a safe and reasonable low-cost mobility usable in any seasons for everyone.

## Concept

Mobility as a substitute for bicycles in winter. (but much slower)

## Feature what we want
- Suitable for moving around nearby places
- A little bit faster than walking
- Low energy consumption
- Space-saving design
- We can use like bicycle or kick scooter.
- Regarded as a pedestrian by the law(?)

## Differences from other mobilities

#### Powered wheelchairs
They are assistive equipments for handicapped people but this will be a mobility for everyone. Non-handicapped people also can use this. We will be able to replace wheelchairs to this if you want.

#### Ultra-compact BEVs
They can move like cars, but we need to have drivers licence. This can be operated by everyone, it doesn't matter you have drivers licence or not.

#### Mobility scooters
They are similar to this but they are designed for elderly people. You can consider this as mobility scooters for everyone.

## Schedule
We have not decided schedule of this project because we couldn't estimate how long does it take to finish one phase.

## We want some person for this project
When we start a business, our company should have three types of members.

## Readme of this repo
We will not put any materials without docs in this main branch until release.

We will have develop branch, it will be main of developing. We also create new branch from that by new function.

We will put developing blog on [our website](freesia.work). ‚Üêthis is a link

We create issue to manage task. Please look at Issues / Projects page.
