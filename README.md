# neu-mobil
The new mobility for everyone.

## Purpose of this project

Automobiles are so cool. We can go everywhere as long as the road lasts. We get speed by driving a car. Engine sound makes us excited. Cars are fun.

Think, is automobile a reasonable transportation method to move people? We may answer "Yes" if there are four people with big suitcases and we want to go to the place very far from here. We can enjoy talking in the car and we don't have to mind other persons. The traveling cost per person is low. Our travel will be so fun. Then, if there is only me and I want to go to near place with small luggage? I will answer "No". The traveling cost won't change by the number of person in the car so I have to pay the cost of four people. When it is a snowing day, we have to clear the snow on the roof. Cars need wide space to park. We don't need high speed to go to near place. Moving big lump of metal for only one person is not reasonable. Bicycle doesn't consume any fuel or electricity and it will be reasonable mobility but we can't ride them in winter and they have a risk of overturning. Then, we want to make a safe and reasonable low-cost mobility for everyone.

## Concept

Mobility as a substitute for bicycles in winter.

## Feature what we want
- Suitable for moving around nearby places
- Low energy consumption
- Space-saving design
- We can use like bicycle
- Regarded as a pedestrian by the law

## Differences from other mobilities

#### Powered wheelchairs
They are assistive equipments for handicapped people but this will be a mobility for everyone. Non-handicapped people also can use this. We will be able to replace wheelchairs to this if you want.

#### Ultra-compact BEVs
They can move like cars, but we need to have drivers licence. This can be operated by everyone, it doesn't matter you have drivers licence or not.

#### Mobility scooters
They are similar to this but they are designed for elderly people. You can consider this as mobility scooters for everyone.
